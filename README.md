# Roco's Restaurant – Version 1

This is an early project I created for **Roco’s Restaurant**, a local family-run eatery, before I started learning React. It’s a static website built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks, no databases, just hand-coded from scratch.

I’ve kept this version online as a showcase of what I could do before diving into modern web development tools. A React version is in the works!

## 🔍 Project Overview

The site includes:

- **Landing Page (index.html):** Features a full-screen hero video to grab attention and convey the restaurant’s vibe.
- **Contact Page:** Includes a direct link to WhatsApp, connecting users with the owner (my mother-in-law) for orders and inquiries.
- **Menu Page:** Displays all current dishes and prices in a clean, readable layout.
- **Promotions Page:** Highlights ongoing or seasonal deals.
- **Footer Map:** An embedded map for easy navigation to the restaurant.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully usable on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

> 💡 Everything is hardcoded — no backend or dynamic content. It’s a great example of how far you can go with just the web fundamentals.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide a simple online presence for Roco’s Restaurant.
- Make it easy for customers to view the menu and get in touch.
- Practice and showcase core web development skills without relying on libraries or frameworks.

## 🚀 Future Plans

I'm planning to rebuild this project as a **React** app with the following upgrades:

- Dynamic content from a backend or CMS
- Admin panel for updating menu and promotions
- Improved animations and interactivity
- Accessibility improvements
